# OrgM
A jython macro to automate to measure the diameter and area of organoids from brightfield images

This program is saved as a Python script but MUST be run inside the microscopy analysis program FIJI [(Fiji is just image J)](https://imagej.net/software/fiji/downloads). The input is brightfield images of single organoids (or any object you wish to measure).  
The images can be aquired manually or with an automated microscopy stage.

The input for OrgM is a signle directory containing images.

This repository contains a user guide with screen shots and step by step instructions as well as example images and
